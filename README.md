# swimming
A look at swimmers times for various events throughout history. 

Some analysis, modelling and git famaliarisation would be nice to explore.

Questions I would like to answer:
1. What event has seen in the most progress in times getting quicker compared the others?
--- A time series of average times and the lines representing the different events

2. Linear regression - Arima to predict the times that will be achived past the latest entry date of the data set. 
For example. Using the progression of 200m Freestyle up to 2010. How accurate is a prediction made looking at 2020 olympics.

3. Finally  building on point 2, have all predictions made for all events for the upcoming olympics in Paris. Each event withan evaluation metric as to the certainty of time.
